# ``Euclid/Rotation``

## Topics

### Creating Rotations

- ``Rotation/init(_:)-5w6mn``
- ``Rotation/init(_:)-68leo``
- ``Rotation/init()``
- ``Rotation/init(axis:angle:)``
- ``Rotation/init(pitch:yaw:roll:)``
- ``Rotation/init(roll:yaw:pitch:)``
- ``Rotation/init(yaw:pitch:roll:)``
- ``Rotation/identity``

### Creating Rotations Around an Axis

- ``Rotation/pitch(_:)``
- ``Rotation/roll(_:)``
- ``Rotation/yaw(_:)``

### Inspecting Rotations

- ``Rotation/forward``
- ``Rotation/right``
- ``Rotation/up``
- ``Rotation/pitch``
- ``Rotation/roll``
- ``Rotation/yaw``

### Computing with Rotations

- ``Rotation/-(_:)``
- ``Rotation/*(_:_:)``

### Updating Rotations

- ``Rotation/*=(_:_:)``

### Comparing Rotations

- ``Rotation/!=(_:_:)``

### Encoding and Decoding Rotations

- ``Rotation/encode(to:)``
- ``Rotation/init(from:)``
